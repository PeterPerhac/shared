"When he's up at Covint Gardin you can see 'im a standin' all alone, / Won't join in a quiet little Tommy Dodd (half-pint of beer), drinking Scotch and Soda on 'is own, / 'E 'as the cheek and impidence to call 'is muvver 'is Ma, / Since Jack Jones came into a little bit o' splosh, well 'e dunno where 'e are." - Thanks to Frank Haigh for the explanation of the source]

Fag (cigarette)	Oily Rag	Give us an oily. [Thanks to David Hughes]
Fag (cigarette)	Toe Rag / Tow Rag	Lend us a sprarsy - I wanna get some toe-rags [Thanks to Mike Smith. Mike says he thinks toe-rags refer to the rags people used to wrap around their feet when they didn't have shoes… we used to call our socks toe-rags which is probably the same origin. He also says his old dad used to call some people a toe-rag and suspects it might have been an insult (reference to fag = queer).] 

[Martin McKerrell adds that toe rag referred to a small time petty thief, in his words "the sort of dirty little toe rag who would live next door and break into your house and nick the Christmas presents".] [Gillian adds "term is commonly used, at least in Scotland, meaning just a bit stronger than "rascal" and probably spelled without the e: 'You little torag.' I always thought it did come from terms used to refer to travelling people."][And Michael Kendix adds:  I heard that "Toe rag" came from "Taureg" a nomadic people living in the Arabian desert, regarded by colonial powers as "low life's".  So, it would be insulting to refer to someone as a "Toe rag", which, as you say, could be used to describe a ne'er do well!  And Paul offers a somewhat disturbing image: In the times of Nelsons navy paper was too expensive to use in the head (toilet) and so sailors would get a short length of rope (toe) and unravel it until it resemble rags (toe-rag), this would then be used instead of paper and had the added benefit that t could be washed and re-used.]

Go	Scapa Flow	Scapa! [Actually pronounced 'Scarper' - just one example of not being satisfied with the slang, they then mispronounce the word to thoroughly confuse everyone.  Robert Benoist sent me the following which I found interesting:  Scapa Floe was a Royal Naval base established in the 20th Century and famous for the scuttling of the German fleet in 1919 and a subsequent WW11 battle. Before 1919 it is doubtful whether anyone in the country let alone cockneys would have heard of it.

In Mayhew's London Labour and the London Poor (vol 3 1851) there is a chapter on Punch Talk (basically the slang language used by traveling Italian Punch and Judy men and entertainers). This slang contains both English and Italian roots. In Punch Talk "To get away quickly" e.g. from the police or authority is spoken and written as scarper. This comes from the Italian Scappare. Punch talk formed one of the roots of Polari which also incorporated rhyming slang and was used first by the east end street traders, and then the west end street traders, and finally by homosexuals in the 40's and 50's. There are almost as many Polari expressions currently used as there are rhyming slang. It is probable that after 1919 it was imagined that the word had originated in the rhyming slang after Scapa Floe but I think the evidence firmly points to its Italian Origins.]

Slag (prostitute)	Toe Rag / Tow Rag	She’s a right toe rag [Thanks to Chris Roberts.  Mike Lyons adds: It should be 'Tow Rag'.  When a car towed another in times past, (broken down car) behind it, it was/is common practice to tie a piece of rag halfway along the rope between the two vehicles. This was to indicate the rope's presence to pedestriams, particularly when stopped in traffic. (i.e. to stop people tripping over it when walking between the cars).  As this piece of rag was literally dragging or 'always in' the dirt all the time, it was compared with someone who was shifty, untrustworthy, criminal, loafer, a general 'low life'.  Such a person was called a tow rag, example "don't trust him, he's a bit of a tow rag".]  Thus, a tow rag could refer to a male or female of dubious character.

Watch (fob watch)	Kettle and Hob	That's a lovely kettle [Thanks to Mark Sparrow. I got the following from Dudley who wondered about the connection between a kettle and a watch - he passed on the following story:

It was commonplace for everyone to wear a pocket watch and chain in the waistcoat & it was also equally commonplace for the watch to be in the pawn shop as an interim loan security - however no one was keen for people to know that this situation was necessary, so the chain would be kept and worn as normal. In the kitchens of the day the fire would be an open one and there would be a bar or hook above it from which a length of chain would be secured and from there the kettle would be suspended above the fire to boil. So with this in mind, if the pocket watch chain, with no weight on it to hold it in the pocket, fell out and dangled minus the missing watch, there would always be some clever Charlie ready to pipe up "What's that for then, your bleedin' kettle?"

Dave Walker provided the following:  The origin of "kettle" comes from illicit spirit making, distilled in what were large coppers known as kettles, hence, kettle of scotch = watch. I have always understood this to be the true origin, and it does rhyme, after all.
