Aren’t you tired of 
pacing back and forth?
so un-at-home 
in your own skin

Your jaded eyes
been in the black too long
groping and blundering

No one can soothe your woes 
nothing can rock your boat
sun never shines in your
own private Idaho

Open wide your weary arms 
to a brand new day

You’re watching earth from your exile
a tiny isle too far offshore
stare at the stars tonight
and reconcile to the obscure

True to the role that you portray
stabbed by the blade that you wield 
your wound’s so hard to heal
you fail to feel the beauty in here

You keep afloat
aloof and all alone
thrown into thorough disarray
your piece of land
is bound to wash ashore
your realm’s about to wane
oo-oooh you king of fools
lone heart laden with rue

May your eyes come to light 
from abysmal depths 

You’re watching earth from your exile
a tiny isle too far offshore
stare at the sky tonight
and lay aside your tomahawks

True to the role that you portray
stabbed by the blade that you wield
you say your wound can’t heal
that you can’t feel the beauty in here

You live a life in black and white
under a lowering thunderhead
your soul harbors a rage 
you can’t contain nor comprehend

True to the role that you portray
stabbed by the blade that you wield
your wound’s so hard to heal
you find no peace - in here
