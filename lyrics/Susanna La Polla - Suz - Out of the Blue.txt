Ancient forces are awakening
Suddenly the earth’s crust quakes
Nature slowly starts to take its toll

Can’t you see the raging flood
Sweeps away the flowers buds
Blows away the meaning of it all

though we thought that we were strong
suddenly the night gets long
seems that it will never find the day

but now please don’t get me wrong
find what’s hidden in this song
right here in the twisting of my tongue

Chorus: Time’s running short
When a lifetime is all that we got (x2)

Can’t you see the afterglow of sunset giving place to dusky twilight while the shadows start to follow you?
Can’t you feel the movements of the planets in the nighttime while your dreaming seems to hear them softly calling you?
Can’t you hear the music growing louder in the morning while you try to catch a glimpse of what’s surrounding you?
Would you say that everything is just the same as it was when the only colour that we could discern was blue?

though we thought that we were strong
suddenly the night gets long
seems that it will never find the day

but now please don’t get me wrong
find what’s hidden in this song
right here in the twisting of my tongue

Chorus: Songs will be sung
Sun is high but the morning’s still young (x6)
