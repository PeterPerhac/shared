Harken to the chimes
On this crystal spring
Hear their soothing tinkles
When blown by the wind
As your lyrics mingle
With their gentle swing
They’ll  unveil the grace
In simple things
You are the music, make the music last
Rhythm’s within you
Let your smooth rhymes spread
 
Chorus:
Could you bear the noise
Of a silenced voice?
The weight of no sound
Bang a gong
And let one be a crowd
 
Harken to the pipes
Floating on the breeze
Hear their tuneful notes
Hear them fill the spheres
 
You  are the music
Make the music last
Rhythm’s within you
Let your smooth rhymes spread
 
Chorus:
Could you bear the noise
Of a silenced voice?
The weight of no sound
Bang a gong
And let one be a crowd
