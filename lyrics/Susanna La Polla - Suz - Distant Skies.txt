Don’t say a word
Don’t shout that it was not your fault
silence will be louder than bombs
thundering under distant skies (x2)
 
On the horizon I see signals of a war
No chance for love
we’re on our knees
No you won’t win my feelings with your pot of gold
your empty soul
is all I see
 
Don’t say a word
Don’t shout that it was not your fault
silence will be louder than bombs
thundering under distant skies (x2)
 
Daydream is over, we lost clarity of thoughts
crossed the threshold
of sanity
Better not ask me to give it a second go
what scares us most
will set us free
 
Don’t say a word
Don’t shout that it was not your fault
silence will be louder than bombs
thundering under distant skies (x2)
 
Just time to take a bow and let the curtains close
Let’s start to draw
a brand new scene
We had it all but then it all went up in smoke
The worst of blows
you dealt on me
 
Don’t say a word
don’t shout that it was not your fault
silence will be louder than bombs
thundering under distant skies (x 4)
